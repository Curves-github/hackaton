## Nearest.cc

Nearest.cc is a first decentralized NFT rating which is also a game.

Nearest.cc app offers a way to find out the actual value of NFTs based on unbiased public opinion.

**Play.** You get access to several pools of NFTs from major marketplaces. The artworks are mixed into pairs—and you pick the ones that you like better (or skip the selection when you can’t make up your mind).

**Vote.** Everyone starts with 50 free votes. You can get more for inviting friends to play and being an active Nearest user. Or—just buy more votes, it’s a free economy.

**Discover.** Nearest rating is a new way to explore the incredibly diverse world of tokenized art. Our independent ratings will shine the light on overlooked masterpieces and art underdogs. So, you’ll always know what has real value on marketplaces and what’s a fluke.

**Earn.** This isn’t just a game. Your actions and participation will be rewarded. And if you have a keen eye for real masterpieces and vote for rating leaders-to-be, your rewards will be much more sizeable.

The front-end is built using the React framework along with the MobX library. The logic itself is moved to Mobx, while React only renders the DOM. There are no API requests to the server, instead near-api-js and blockchain transactions are used. Contracts are implemented for NEAR in AssemblyScript.
